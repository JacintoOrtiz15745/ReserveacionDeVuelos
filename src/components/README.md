This folder will contain 3 types of components that we will include in our screens:

– Atoms – The smallest possible components, such as buttons, titles, inputs or event color pallets, animations, and fonts.

– Molecules – They are the composition of one or more components of atoms.

– Organisms – The combination of molecules that work together or even with atoms that compose more elaborate interfaces.
